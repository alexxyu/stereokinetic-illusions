# Stereokinetic Illusions

This repository contains Mathematica source code files for different stereokinetic illusions.

## Examples

## Factors
* Components - offset and size
    1. Wheel
    2. Outer rim
    3. Inner rim
* Color
* Speed

## Ruminations and ideas for exploration
* Thickening rims/size of components (thinner = stronger??? too distracting when thick?)
* 4 rims to look for simultaneous expanding and contracting
* Changing circumferntial distances between regions : greater offset = stronger (more contrast to make out regions?)
* Recoloring: (1) different color spaces (2) amount of contrast
* Arcs + slice: effect is noticeable!
